- **Immediate Implementation**: Quick iteration cycles
- **User-Centric**: Focused on actual usage patterns
- **Quality Focus**: Continuous refinement until perfect

## üìà Lessons Learned

### Architecture Decisions
- **Context vs Props**: Context for global state, props for component communication
- **Component Granularity**: Smaller components = better reusability
- **Utility Functions**: Pure functions for complex logic = better testability
- **Storage Strategy**: Local storage perfect for personal productivity apps

### Development Process
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused changes work better than large refactors
- **User Experience First**: Always consider how changes affect user workflow
- **Component Reusability**: Invest in modular design early
- **Documentation Matters**: Good docs make maintenance much easier

This development journey demonstrates how prompt-driven development can create sophisticated, well-architected applications through iterative refinement and careful attention to user experience.
